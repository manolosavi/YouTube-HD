YouTube HD
==========

A Safari extension for YouTube I made for myself.
It makes the YouTube player fit the size of a 15" display, since I made this for my own need, I can't guarantee it won't break other parts of the site. Also, like I said, this is made specifically for a 15" display at native resolution, haven't really gotten into making it work in different sizes.
Here's a few screenshots comparing the regular player sizes and the one with my extension.
