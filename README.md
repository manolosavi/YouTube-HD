YouTube HD
==========

A Safari extension for YouTube I made for myself.
It makes the YouTube player fit the size of the window, since I hacked this together for myself, I can't guarantee it won't break other parts of the site.
Here's a few screenshots comparing the regular player sizes and the one with my extension.
