YouTube HD
==========

A Safari extension for YouTube I made for myself.
It makes the YouTube player fit the size of the window, since I hacked this together for myself, I can't guarantee it won't break other parts of the site. I made it so that it works with the theater view mode, if enabled on the regular view it won't work correctly, just change to theater view and it'll be ok.
Here's a few screenshots comparing the regular player sizes and the one with my extension.
